** Tower of Intention: the layers of [[task|language/en-GB/任务]]s parent-child relationships are strung together to form a tree that looks like a tower, which we call the Tower of Intention
** The most important of these are the bottom [[meaning|language/en-GB/意义]]s, which are the cornerstones of the upper [[task|language/en-GB/任务]]s and [[project|language/en-GB/项目]]s
** [[Intention Tower visualization]]
** Since I forgot to add the source spectrum, it's hard to know if the name was taken as a reference to the [[Tower of Intention Tower in Three Bodies|language/en-GB/The Intention Tower in Three Bodies]] or the [[Tower of the Meta-Lamp God as stated in GEB|https://wiki.onetwo.ren/元灯神]]
