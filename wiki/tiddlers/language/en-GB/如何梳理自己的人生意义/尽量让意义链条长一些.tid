type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The best case scenario is that underneath the meaning associated with a given project, there are also meanings of significance that form a long chain before reaching the base of the [[Intention Tower|language/zh-Hans/意义之塔]].

In this way, when [[measuring the overall level of significance]], the project is felt to be deep and meaningful.
