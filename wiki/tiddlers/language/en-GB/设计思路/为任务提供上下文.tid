In project management, I like to ByteDance's program, "Context, not Control", to provide context, to encourage themselves to do things on the line, the specific when to do not impose restrictions. This program is suitable for creative work that is inherently more free, some work and study tasks are really deadlines, it is not suitable for this loose management mode.

"The 'context' is the current task to be done, what are the parent tasks, and what are the parent tasks, and the parent tasks are the 'meaning' of the existence of the child tasks. Root tasks are the various areas of interest to you, so that you don't forget and touch less fish.
