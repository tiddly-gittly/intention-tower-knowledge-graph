# Provide a <<lingo ShortName>> layout, use `ctrl+shift+L` to switch to this view
## or open it using a layout launcher like <<lingo ShortName $:/plugins/linonetwo/simple-layout-launcher/language/>> on the sidebar
# When the layout opens, there are a few buttons at the top
## On the left is a series of add buttons that, when clicked, jump back to the default layout and add new tiddlers
## On the right are buttons that jump directly back to the default layout
# Once you've added a few tiddlers, a table of data is displayed at the bottom of the layout, listing the tiddlers you've added.
## Clicking on the title of a tiddler in the table will jump back to the default layout and open that entry
